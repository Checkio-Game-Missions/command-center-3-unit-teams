    The Great Colonization is coming and we should work as a team. Or for start we will
    make simple structure for our units and teams. In this mission you need write
    two classes - one simple for units (more like a dictionary) and for teams.

</p>

<p>
    The class "Unit" is a unit base representation. An instance has several propirties

</p>

<p>
    <em>class</em> <strong>Connected</strong><em>(connections)</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">
    Returns a new Connected instance. <em>"connections"</em> is an iterable of sets with two elements
    in each. Each connection contains two names as strings. Connections can be repeated in the
    initial data, but inside it store once. Each connection has only two states - existing or not.

</p>

<pre class="example">
>>> Connected(({"a", "b"}, {"b", "c"}, {"c", "a"}, {"a", "c"}))
>>> Connected([{"1", "2"}, {"3", "1"}])
</pre>
<br>

<p>
    <strong>add</strong>(connection)
</p>
<p class="indent">
    Add a connection in the instance. <em>"connection"</em>
    is a set of two names (strings).
    Returns True if this connection is new.
    Returns False if this connection exists already.
</p>
<pre class="example">
>>> c = Connected([{"1", "2"}, {"3", "1"}])
>>> c.add({"1", "3"})
False
>>> c.add({"4", "5"})
True
</pre>
<br>

<p>
    <strong>remove</strong>(connection)
</p>
<p class="indent">
    Remove a connection from the instance. <em>"connection"</em>
    is a set of two names (strings).
    Returns True if this connection is exist.
    Returns False if this connection is not in the instance.
</p>
<pre class="example">
>>> c = Connected([{"1", "2"}, {"3", "1"}])
>>> c.remove({"1", "3"})
True
>>> c.remove({"4", "5"})
False
</pre>
<br>
<p>
    <strong>names</strong>()
</p>
<p class="indent">
    Returns a set of names. The set contains only names which is connected with somebody.
</p>
<pre class="example">
>>> c = Connected(({"a", "b"}, {"b", "c"}, {"c", "d"}))
>>> c.names()
{"a", "b", "c", "d"}
>>> c.remove({"d", "c"})
True
>>> c.names()
{"a", "b", "c"}
</pre>
<br>
<p>
    <strong>connected</strong>(name)
</p>
<p class="indent">
    Returns a set of names which is connected with the given <em>"name"</em>.
    If "name" is not exists in the instance, then return an empty set.
</p>
<pre class="example">
>>> c = Connected(({"a", "b"}, {"b", "c"}, {"c", "a"}))
>>> c.connected("a")
{"b", "c"}
>>> c.connected("d")
set()
>>> c.remove({"c", "a"})
True
>>> c.connected("c")
{"b"}
>>> c.remove({"c", "b"})
True
>>> c.connected("c")
set()
</pre>

    In this mission all data will be correct and you don't need to implement value checking.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Statements and expression with the Friends class.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The behaviour as described.
</p>


<p class="for_info_only">
    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    Here you will implement a class with mutable states. This is not a simple structure with a
    couple of functions, but object representation with more complex structure.

</p>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong>
    All data are correct.
</p>
